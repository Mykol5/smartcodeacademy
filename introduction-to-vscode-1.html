            <h3>Class Example: Creating a Basic HTML and CSS Project</h3>
            <p>In this example, we will guide you through creating a simple HTML and CSS project using Visual Studio Code. You will also learn how to use the Live Server extension to view your project in a web browser. Follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open Visual Studio Code.</li>
                <li>Create a new folder on your local machine where you'll store your project files. You can name it "MyWebProject" or something similar.</li>
                <li>In VSCode, open your newly created folder by clicking on "File" &rarr; "Open Folder..." and selecting your folder.</li>
                <li>Create a new HTML file by right-clicking on your project folder in the VSCode sidebar, selecting "New File," and naming it "index.html."</li>
                <li>Inside "index.html," write a basic HTML structure:</li>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                        &lt;html&gt;
                        &lt;head&gt;
                            &lt;title&gt;My Web Project&lt;/title&gt;
                            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
                        &lt;/head&gt;
                        &lt;body&gt;
                            &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Web Project&lt;/h1&gt;
                        &lt;/body&gt;
                        &lt;/html&gt;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <li>Create a new CSS file in the same way you created the HTML file, and name it "style.css."</li>
                <li>Inside "style.css," add some basic CSS styles for your project, e.g.:</li>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        body {
                            background-color: #f0f0f0;
                            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
                            text-align: center;
                            margin: 0;
                            padding: 0;
                        }
        
                        h1 {
                            color: #333;
                            margin-top: 100px;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <li>Now, install the Live Server extension by clicking on the "Extensions" icon in the VSCode sidebar, searching for "Live Server," and installing it.</li>
                <li>Once installed, you will see the "Go Live" option in the bottom-right corner of VSCode. Click it to start a local development server.</li>
                <li>VSCode will open a live server in your default web browser, displaying your "My Web Project" page with the applied CSS styles.</li>
                <li>Arrange your VSCode and browser side by side on your screen.</li>
                <li>Take a screenshot of your screen with both VSCode and the browser displaying your project, and save it as "my_web_project_screenshot.jpg."</li>
                <li>Submit your screenshot for assessment.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>By completing this example, you will have created a simple web project, learned how to use HTML and CSS in VSCode, and experienced live preview using the Live Server extension.</p>
        

            <!-- <form id="screenshot-form" enctype="multipart/form-data"> -->
                <input type="file" id="screenshot" name="screenshot" />
                <button id="submit-button">Submit Screenshot</button>
            <!-- </form> -->
                       
        </section>
        
        <section class="result">
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>Your screenshot will be assessed, and you'll receive feedback on your Visual Studio Code setup.</p>
        </section>
